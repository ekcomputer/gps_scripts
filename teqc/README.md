### teqc scripts readme

* mine: extracts data from a bunch of raw files and exports into a spreadsheet
* splice: takes a bunch of hourly rinex files and splices into one (which I would then upload to a PPP tool)
* translate: converts .SBF (Septentrio binary format) GPS files to RINEX (receiver independent exchange format).  Can be easily modified or might work as is for other binary input formats.
* file_management: simple utilities for creating a bunch of folders named by date
